A little bit about me
------
Hi! I'm Kate. I am an applied mathematician with a passion for mathematical biology. More specifically, I am interested in developing mathematical models and tools to inform public health policy. Some of my previous projects include vaccine prioritization for COVID-19 and evaluating the performance of vaccinate-or-test policies in populations with mixed-vaccination status.  

I am currently a Computer Science PhD student in the Larremore Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am also a part of the Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology program at CU's BioFrontiers Institute. I earned a Master's in Applied Math from the University of Colorado Boulder and a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Math and Statistics from the Colorado School of Mines.

I'm originally from Seattle, WA. When I'm not working, I love to play volleyball, try new recipes and paint. 

Please note that my website is still under revision!
