About Me
------
Hi! I'm Kate. I'm a postdoctoral scholar in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University in the Lo Lab. With a background in mathematics, statistics, and infectious disease epidemiology, I am passionate about using data-driven mathematical models to study infectious disease transmission and the impact of public health interventions. My research aims to reduce disease burden and inform public health policy.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder, where I worked with Dan Larremore and was part of the Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology program at CU's BioFrontiers Institute. I also hold a Master's in Applied Math from CU Boulder and a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Math and Statistics from the Colorado School of Mines.

I'm originally from Seattle, WA and love the Pacific Northwest. When I'm not working, I enjoy playing volleyball, trying new recipes, and painting.
