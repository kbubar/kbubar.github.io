About Me
------
Hi! I'm Kate. I build mathematical and statistical models to understand infectious disease dynamics, evaluate interventions, and inform public health policy.

Currently, I'm a postdoc in the [Lo Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/lo-lab.html) at Stanford University. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from CU Boulder working with [Dan Larremore](https://larremorelab.github.io/) as part of the BioFrontiers Institute's Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology program, along with a Master's in Applied Math from CU Boulder and a BS in Applied Math and Statistics from Colorado School of Mines

I'm originally from Seattle, WA and love the Pacific Northwest. In my free time, I love playing volleyball, trying new recipes, and crafting.
